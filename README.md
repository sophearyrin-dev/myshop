# BootStrap5
- Flexbox: 
The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 & 5 is that Bootstrap 5 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.
- Gutter : Is the space between columns in the grid system. and we use gx- and gy-. .gy-*: Vertical gutters.
.gx-*: Horizontal gutters.
  ```html
  <div class="row gx-3">
  <div class="col">
    Column 1

  <div class="col">
    Column 2
  </div>
</div>
