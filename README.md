# BootStrap5
- Flexbox: 
The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 & 5 is that Bootstrap 5 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.
- Gutter : Is the space between columns in the grid system. and we use gx- and gy-. .gy-*: Vertical gutters.
.gx-*: Horizontal gutters.
  ```html
  <div class="row gx-3">
  <div class="col">
    Column 1
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    Column 2
  </div>
</div>

# JS Function
![Alt text](image1.gif)
- Filter
The filter method in JavaScript is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. This method does not mutate the original array but returns a new array with the elements that meet the condition.

- Find
The find method in JavaScript is used to search through an array and return the first element that satisfies a given condition. It is a higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument. This callback function is executed once for each element in the array until it finds one where the callback returns a truthy value. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
